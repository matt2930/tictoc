# Tic Toc

A Python module to make timing in python easier by mimicing MATLAB's `tic` and `toc` functions.
`tic` starts a timer by recording the current time, and `toc` uses the start time to find the elapsed time.

## `tic`

### Usage
```
from tictoc import tic
tic()  # starts global timer
timer = tic()  # assigns an instance of the Timer class to the timer var without affecting the global timer
```

>Note: When using `timer = tic()`, the return value can then be passed later on to the `toc` function

### Examples

```
from time import sleep
from tictoc import tic, toc


tic()
sleep(1)
toc()
```
